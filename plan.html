<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan - CossiePlay</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Alexander Von Kurtz<br>
  <strong>Login:</strong> 131 61 660</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The goal is to develop a website that appeals to a younger target audience and makes them want to be involved with what CossiePlay has to offer.</p>
<p>By appealing to a younger audience, both crowd numbers and revenue will increase.<br>
The website will be developed in a simple and clear manner that will reduce the need for "page hopping" so therefore the message of what Cossieplay<br>
has to offer is quickly delivered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>The sites success can be monitored by the number of Sign-Up's or Store enquiries that have been requested/mailed.<br></p>
As the site does offer a range of contactable features the customer will have numerous options in order to contact CossiePlay<br>
and therefore success can be measured by what path the customer chooses to use.
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Currently CossiePlay is appealing to an older target audience between the ages of 35 to 50. <br>
The goal is to appeal to a younger target audience that ranges from teens to early adolescence (18-23).<br>
However, the site should still be appealing to the older target audience in order to not lose current customers</p>
